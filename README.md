Last edited: 4/28

## Set up
Requirements:
Yarn and Node v10. (V10 its important, otherwise gulp may fail).
 
Steps: 
```
git clone https://github.com/RECEIPT-H2020/TerriaMap.git
cd TerriaMap
mkdir packages && cd packages
git clone https://github.com/RECEIPT-H2020/terriajs.git
cd ..
nvm use 10 <- it is necessary to run gulp on node version 10
yarn install
npx gulp
```

Note: you may need to run gulp sync-terriajs-dependencies and then yarn install and npx gulp again
Note 2: PM2 causes problems with old installations. run `rm -rf ~/.pm2` to clean up or `npx pm2 update`
 
 
 ## Run locally
from TerriaMaps folder:
```
nvm use 10 ## if using nvm locally to ensure you are on nodejs version 10
npm start
npx gulp watch
```

## Manual deploy
The deploy pipeline runs when pushing to release branch (master on 'receipt').
```
npx gulp release

```
### Set up deploy
on Firebase hosting is needed to get a auth_token:
Github requires a FIREBASE_TOKEN to be able to deploy your Angular app to Firebase. Generate a token for firebase ci:
```
install npm i -g firebase-tools
firebase login:ci ##returns a token to be used in a CI server
```
### Please note:
- If the map doesn't load, you may have to clear your browser cache, cookies and other site data. (Only clearing the cache is not enough!)

- Master Banches for out forks are named 'receipt'
If you create a feature branch, try to change one branch at the time, and make sure that everything runs properly with the master branches of the rest of the repositories before pushing.
- Use prettier while formatting your code and set it up to prettify on 'file save'
Cesium Access token

  
You can create a new token at https://cesium.com/ion or use the temporary token:
 
```TerriaMap > wwwroot > config.json ```

inside the parameters object: 

```cesiumIonAccessToken: <ACCESS_TOKEN>```
