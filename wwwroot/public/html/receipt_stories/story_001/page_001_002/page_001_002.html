        In the global economy, our food systems rely on products sourced from all corners of the Earth.
        There has been an overall increase in the world soybean harvested area: from 20 million ha in 1960 to 120
        million ha in 2013

        Most soybeans are grown in the USA, Brazil and Argentina. Argentina is the world’s leading soybean meal exporter

        The country grew 20 million hectares of soybeans in 2015

        and the crop remains the country's main export - typically, 92%-93% of Argentinian soy is exported

        reduced by localised flooding

        </sup>– and yields have suffered due to drought . This spells disaster for the country – it is reliant on
        soybean
        monoculture so its economy is highly vulnerable to the volatility of commodity prices.
        Brazil is one of the most important soybean suppliers globally, producing more than a third of the world’s
        soybean supplies

        approximately 5 billion U.S. dollars losses.
