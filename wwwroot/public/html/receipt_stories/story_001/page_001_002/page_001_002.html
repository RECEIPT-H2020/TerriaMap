                  In the global economy, our food systems rely on products sourced from all corners of the Earth. 
                  There has been an overall increase in the world soybean harvested area: from 20 million ha in 1960 to 120 million ha in 2013 
                  [1]. Most soybeans are grown in the USA, Brazil and Argentina. Argentina is the world’s leading soybean meal exporter
                  [2]. The country grew 20 million hectares of soybeans in 2015
                  [3] and the crop remains the country's main export - typically, 92%-93% of Argentinian soy is exported
                  [4], so the current restrictions will have a significant impact. In recent years, the harvest areas have been reduced by localised flooding
                  [5]– and yields have suffered due to drought . This spells disaster for the country – it is reliant on soybean monoculture so its economy is highly vulnerable to the volatility of commodity prices.
                  Brazil is one of the most important soybean suppliers globally, producing more than a third of the world’s soybean supplies
                  [6]. Brazil's 2021/22 soybean production is estimated at 50 million metric tons (mmt), amounting to approximately 5 billion U.S. dollars losses.
