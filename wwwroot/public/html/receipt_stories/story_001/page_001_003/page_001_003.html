        Drought has been identified as a main climate stressor for soybean production.
        Climate variability has negatively affected soybean yields in South America in the past, yet the 2021/22 growing
        season has been particularly poor.
        Decreases in yields of 30-40% across Brazil and Argentina have, in part, been driven by the huge environmental
        and social degradation problems in parts of South America .
        The expansion of soybean production has led to mass deforestation over the past 40 years , as well as
        biodiversity loss, fires and significant emissions of greenhouse gases.
        It is thought that a fifth of Brazilian soy exported to Europe is a direct result of deforestation

        In Argentina, soybeans have become the cash crop for half of arable land , more than 11m hectares (27m acres),
        most situated on fragile pampas lands on the vast plains

        The country’s reliance on this one crop is raising fears of economic ruin.
        Most of the soya grown in Argentina is genetically modified (GM) and is grown and sold by global large-scale
        companies.
        During the last agricultural season (2019–20), GM soybeans were cultivated on nearly 20.5 million hectares,
        which represented 60% of total land cultivated, and production reached a record 61 million tonnes
