          El Niño events significantly impact Earth’s ecosystems and human societies.
          Extreme drought, flooding, rains and temperature rises in South America over the past 50 years have influenced
          food supplies and prices and have led to a wide range of health problems,
          including disease outbreaks, malnutrition, heat stress and respiratory diseases

          Soybean farming is highly mechanised.
          In both Brazil and Argentina, the sector concentrated in the hands of large producers, so declining soybean
          yields has minimal direct impact on employment.
          The increase in the soybean agribusiness, and the resultant growth in the land area covered by this crop, led
          thousands of small dairy farms to close down and to the displacement of rural communities to larger cities in
          the early part of the Century.
          As a result, the production of many staple foods, such as milk, rice, maize, potatoes and lentils, has fallen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consequently, while the reduction in soybean yields does not have a significant direct impact on employment,
          it does have an enormous indirect impact on food security.
          Soaring costs of domestic meat and dairy is leading to unemployment across the food manufacturing sector,
          which employs around 10 million people across the region.
