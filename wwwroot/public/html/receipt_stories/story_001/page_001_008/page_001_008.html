          Disruption to food production in the EU will have a significant impact on food systems worldwide.
          For example, the EU is the biggest exporter of pork and pork products – it exported about 13% of its total
          production, mostly to east Asia, in particular China

          </sup>, where demand for meat continues to rise.
          It is also a major exporter of dairy products and is the biggest cheese exporter in the world.
        </p>
        <p>While compromising the EU’s ability to meet global demand for these products, a continued deficit in soybean
          supply in the EU may result in a greater dependency on importing meat and dairy products from elsewhere. China
          could be a source of imports as the largest pork and egg producer and the second-largest poultry producer in
          the world. However, trade tensions between the USA and China are driving China to import soybeans from South
          America

          </sup>. – it is the leading country of destination for Brazilian soybean exports and is, thereby, increasingly
          vulnerable to drought in the region. If its soybean supplies are disrupted,
          it is possible that China will prioritise feeding its own growing population over export sales.
