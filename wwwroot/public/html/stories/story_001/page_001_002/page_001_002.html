<h4 class="title">The EU’s reliance on South America for soybean imports</h4>
<p>
  Rising demand for meat and dairy products has led this protein crop to rocket in popularity in the 21st Century.
  Today, it has become a lynchpin of the EU’s economy, and a cornerstone of its food system.
  The bloc imports 14 million tonnes of soybeans every year - more than any other region in the world.
  Most come from Brazil and Argentina and are imported as raw beans or ground meal.
</p>
<p>
  Like any crop, soybeans need the right growing conditions to thrive.
  As the climate changes, regional weather patterns in South America have become less predictable.
  More frequent and intense storms, droughts, floods and higher temperatures are repeatedly hitting yields, resulting in widespread disruption far beyond the continent.
  Intense competition for reduced supplies means market prices are at an all-time high.
</p>
<p>
  The EU’s reliance on this ‘green gold’ is proving to be high risk.
  Its agricultural economy and food system are shaking as price of meat and dairy products soars and it faces widespread, multi-sectoral impacts.
</p>
<!-- <p>
  In the global economy, our food systems rely on products sourced from all corners of the Earth.
  There has been an overall increase in the world soybean harvested area: from 20 million ha in 1960 to 120
  million ha in 2013
