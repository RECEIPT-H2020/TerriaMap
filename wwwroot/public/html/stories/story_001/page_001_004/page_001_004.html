                As global temperatures continue to rise due to climate change,
                South America has experienced more frequent and intense storms and drought due to El Niño,
                one of the most important climatic phenomena on Earth which influences global temperatures (usually
                increased heat), and precipitation.
                An El Niño condition occurs when surface water in the equatorial Pacific becomes warmer than average and
                east winds blow weaker than usual .
                The warming creates an interaction between the surface layers of the tropical Pacific Ocean and the
                atmosphere over it.
                As global temperatures rise due to climate change, the frequency and intensity of El Niño events have
                increased.
