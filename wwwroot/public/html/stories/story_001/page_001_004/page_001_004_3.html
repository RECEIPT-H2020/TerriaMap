          Faced with reduced yields, the Brazilian and Argentine governments have halted soybean exports to protect their domestic meat sectors.
          These are critical for their countriesâ€™ food security, socio-political and economic stability because, when millions of hectares of savannahs, grasslands and rainforests were cleared to make way for soybean production, thousands of small dairy farms closed down and many rural communities were displaced to larger cities.
          That means fewer staples such as milk, rice, maize, potatoes and lentils are produced domestically as affordable food for citizens.

          The drought is also causing problems with soybean transportation. Receding river levels have caused severe disruption to the waterways to Santarem and the Parana River port complex.
          In addition,  exports from the Brazilian port of Santos are still significantly reduced following severe damage in 2028, partly as a result of flooding and due to structural damage caused by ongoing sea level rise.
