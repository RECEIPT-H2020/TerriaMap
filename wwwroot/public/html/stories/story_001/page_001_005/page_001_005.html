          The EU’s dependency on soybean imports means that drought in South America directly threatens its own food, jobs and economic security.
          Under climate change, the vulnerability of the EU’s soybean imports to drought will increase, on average, by 26% by 2050.
          The predicted increase in vulnerability to drought is highest for soybeans originating from Brazil, at around 30%, followed by an increase of 25-28% in Argentina.

          With supplies of South American soybeans temporarily halted, EU farmers are increasingly struggling to feed their livestock.
          Consequently, they are having to streamline production and increase costs.
          This is leading to higher priced, reduced supplies of daily food products on supermarket shelves.
          Prices of farmed salmon, chicken, pork, eggs and cheese have already increased across the bloc.
          Consumers are starting to stockpile food, which is putting further pressure on constrained supplies.

          Unemployment in the agricultural and food sectors is rising.
          Food manufacturing is the largest job sector in the EU, employing XXX million people.
          Many of these jobs are in rural and peripheral regions and are most concentrated in Mazowiecki region in Poland and Bretagne in France, where they account for 14.8% and 13.8% of total employment, respectively.
