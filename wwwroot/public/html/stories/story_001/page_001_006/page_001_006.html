          Governments are acutely aware that keeping everyone fed at affordable prices is crucial for socio-political
          and economic stability, as well as for food security.
          In South America, soy is a key feed ingredient for its own booming meat industry.
          Brazil’s domestic market consumed 23% of its soybean production, predominantly to sustain its feed and
          livestock industries, which are among the largest in the world

          With yields in this year’s growing season seriously reduced, worries over making sure there’s enough food for
          its own citizens – and to sustain its own livestock industry - have led domestic supply be prioritised over
          export sales.

          Regional problems with coastal infrastructure have also been a contributory factor to this decision.
          Brazil’s northern port of Santarem has become the primary location for the country's growing exports yet lack
          of investment into rail and train infrastructure means it continues to rely on waterways to carry soybeans
          from Mato Grosso to port.

          Reduced water levels have disrupted these waterways .
          Exports from the Brazilian port of Santos are still significantly reduced following severe damage in 2021 as a
          result of flooding, and there is a significant concern that sea-level rise due to climate change will cause
          structural damage to critical infrastructure.

          This has led to disruption at its port complex along the Parana River.
          Export supplies are reduced due to the inability to transport them to port.
