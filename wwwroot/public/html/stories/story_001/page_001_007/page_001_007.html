          Due to its reliance on imports of soybeans,
          the severity of this year’s drought in Brazil and Argentina poses a direct threat to the EU’s food and
          economic security.
          Prices of farmed salmon, chicken, pork, eggs and cheese have already increased across the bloc as decreased
          soybean yields have led to higher prices, on average 20%.

        <p>
          News that Brazil will temporarily halt sales of new soybean shipments and Argentina will cut exports in order
          to prevent local shortages signals further disruption to EU’s supplies. Unless a solution can be negotiated to
          the soybean crisis soon, or alternative feed supplies sourced rapidly, both the livestock sector - and the
          EU’s meat and dairy sector – face trouble. Farmers who are unable to feed their livestock will have to reduce
          production. This will have financial implications for farmers and lead to higher priced, reduced supplies of
          daily food products on supermarket shelves.
          There is likely to be a knock-on impact across a multitude of other sectors, from restaurants to food
          manufacturers.
          The impacts on the economy and unemployment will be significant.
          In 2016, food manufacturing was the largest manufacturing sector in the EU in terms of employment

          4.3 million citizens work in the sector, representing 3.0% of total employment of the non-financial business
          economy

          Many of these jobs were in rural and peripheral regions, underlining the importance of food manufacturing as a
          key provider of employment opportunities for these communities.
          Some examples of areas with a very high reliance on food manufacturing for employment are the Mazowiecki
          region in Poland (14.8% of total employment) and Bretagne in France (13.8%)
